# PWA Setup Guide - TestRestaurant Restaurant

## What's a PWA (Progressive Web App)?

Your website is now a **Progressive Web App**, which means users can:
- ✅ **Install it on their phone** like a native app
- ✅ **Receive push notifications** for new reservations
- ✅ **Use it offline** (basic functionality)
- ✅ **Get a better mobile experience** with app-like navigation

- Try closing and reopening the app

### App not updating
- Close the app completely
- Clear browser cache

## Server Push Notifications (Configured)

### ✅ VAPID Keys Setup
The app now has server-side push capabilities using Web Push API:

1. **VAPID keys generated** and stored in `.env`:
   - `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` - For client subscriptions
   - `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` - For server sending (keep secret!)

2. **API endpoints created**:
   - `GET /api/push/vapid-public-key` - Returns public key for subscriptions
   - `POST /api/push/subscribe` - Stores push subscriptions (admin only)
   - `POST /api/push/send` - Sends push notifications to all subscribed clients (admin only)

3. **Auto-subscribe**: Admin users are automatically subscribed to push when they log in

### Send Push Notification from Server

You can send push notifications using the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://www.TestRestaurant.ch/api/push/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Nouvelle réservation",
    "body": "Client - 14 Feb à 19:30",
    "url": "/admin"
  }'
```

### Production Setup

For Vercel/Netlify, add these environment variables:
- `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` - The public key from `.env`
- `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` - The private key from `.env`

**⚠️ Important**: Never commit `.env` to git - it contains your private key!

### Better Icons
- Create custom 192x192 and 512x512 icons (currently using logo.png)
- Use a tool like [PWA Asset Generator](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator)

### Offline Booking
- Cache booking form
- Store submissions in IndexedDB when offline
- Sync when back online using Background Sync API

## Deploy Notes

After deploying, users need to:
1. **First-time users**: Just visit the site and install
2. **Existing users**: May need to refresh or reinstall to get PWA features
3. **Service worker updates**: Automatic on next visit (cache busting)

The PWA will work immediately after deploy on Vercel/Netlify - no extra configuration needed!
